          <p>
            Our Journey at began with a deep-seated appreciation for aesthetics
            and a keen eye for detail. This innate sense of beauty and style,
            combined with a determination to deliver excellence, led to the
            creation of La Verita.

                <p>
                  For many years, I can recall that I've always wanted a
                  One-Stop shop for women concerning beauty and appearance.
                  <br /><br />Upon arriving Nigeria in 2013 and
                  discovering/witnessing all the beautiful and stylish
                  well-travelled women bought, wore and cherished their hair. I
                  thought, what if I make human hair extensions to look like
                  what is admired most about us as women of colour, that is, the
                  texture, volume, density and length of our hair.
                  <br /><br />What if, I merge beauty with luxury? Right here in
                  Nigeria the most popular country in Africa?
                </p>

                <p>
                  This led to the birth of
                  <span class="bold">'The Truth'</span> and was later renamed
                  <span class="bold">La Verita;</span> which is now the brand.
